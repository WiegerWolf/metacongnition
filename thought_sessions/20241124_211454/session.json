The basic question has two parts: (1) defining what free will actually means and (2) determining if humans possess it. Initial consideration suggests this is a complex philosophical problem that intersects with questions of consciousness, determinism, moral responsibility, and the nature of human decision-making.",

This framework should account for both the neurological constraints we've discovered and the undeniable human experience of making conscious choices. We should also consider how this model could be practically implemented in social institutions while respecting both scientific evidence and human dignity. Perhaps free will is best understood as our capacity for 'meta-decision making' - our ability to reflect on, evaluate, and gradually modify our decision-making processes, even if individual decisions are heavily influenced by factors outside our conscious control.",
