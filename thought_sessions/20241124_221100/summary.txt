Thought: Starting with our understanding of free will as a spectrum of agency and meta-decision making capaci...
Reasoning: Further thinking is needed because we haven't yet:
1. Fully applied the spectrum model of free will ...
Referenced Insights:
- From 20241124_211454: Free will exists as a capacity for meta-decision making, where our agency varies by context from reflexive actions to complex moral choices
- From 20241124_211454: The framework suggests free will exists as a spectrum rather than a binary property
